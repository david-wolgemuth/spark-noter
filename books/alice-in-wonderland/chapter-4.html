    <h3> Chapter VI: Pig and Pepper </h3>
    <h4> Grade 5 </h4>

    <p> In Chapter VI, titled 'Pig and Pepper,' Alice encounters a footman in the woods, who delivers an invitation from the Queen to play croquet to the Duchess. Alice observes the footmen's powdered hair and watches as their curls get entangled. She tries to knock on the door of the house but is told it's useless due to the noise coming from inside. The Footman informs her the Duchess is making a lot of noise and that she might not be able to get in at all. Undeterred, Alice knocks on the door again and is let in. Inside the house, she finds the Duchess sitting on a stool, nursing a baby while the cook stirs a cauldron of soup. Alice remarks on the excessive amount of pepper in the air and asks why the cat grins. The Duchess responds rudely and ignores the cook's violent throwing of objects around the room. The Duchess sings a lullaby and shakes the baby violently. Alice takes the baby in her arms and starts to suspect it might be turning into a pig. She sets it down, relieved to see it trot away, and encounters the Cheshire Cat. The Cat tells her that everyone in this strange place is mad, including Alice herself. The cat disappears and reappears, asking about the baby's transformation and then vanishing again. Alice continues on her way to find the March Hare's house, contemplating the curious nature of the cat's grin. </p>
