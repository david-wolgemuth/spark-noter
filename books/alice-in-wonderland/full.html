    <h3> Chapter XII: Alice’s Evidence </h3>
    <h4> Grade 6 </h4>

    <p> In Chapter XII, Alice jumps up in a hurry and accidentally tips over the jury-box, causing the jurymen to fall on the heads of the crowd. She quickly picks them up, reminiscent of a previous incident with goldfish. The King insists that the trial cannot proceed until all the jurymen are back in their proper places. Alice realizes that she had put the Lizard in the jury-box upside down and corrects it. The jury then diligently writes out a history of the accident. The King questions Alice about her knowledge of the business, to which she responds that she knows nothing. The White Rabbit interrupts with a letter that has just been picked up, but it turns out to be a set of verses instead. The King and the jury try to decipher the meaning of the verses, while Alice expresses her disbelief in their significance. The King orders the jury to consider their verdict, but the Queen insists on having the sentence first. Alice defies the Queen, declaring that they are nothing but a pack of cards. The pack of cards rises up and flies at Alice, causing her to wake up from her dream. Alice tells her sister about her strange adventures, and her sister reflects on the wonderful dream and imagines Alice sharing her adventures with her own children in the future. </p>
